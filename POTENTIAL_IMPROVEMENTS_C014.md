# IMaint Lite: Potential Improvements (C014)

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the IMaint Lite maintenance management system, focusing on improvements that would increase functionality, performance, and code maintainability.

## 1. Entity Management Enhancements

### Entity Deletion
Currently, IMaint Lite supports creating and updating various entities (assets, work orders, inventory items, etc.) but lacks comprehensive deletion functionality. Implementing proper entity deletion would include:

- **Soft Delete Implementation**: Add `isDeleted` or `deletedAt` fields to all entity tables to support soft deletion
- **Cascading Deletion**: Proper handling of related records when a parent entity is deleted
- **Deletion Constraints**: Business rules to prevent deletion of entities that are in use or have historical significance
- **Restoration Capability**: Interface for restoring soft-deleted entities when needed
- **Deletion Audit Trails**: Recording who deleted an entity and when for compliance purposes

### Bulk Operations
- Add support for bulk creation, updates, and deletion of entities
- Implement batch processing for large-scale operations
- Create interface elements for selecting multiple items and applying actions

## 2. Performance Optimization

### Pagination Implementation
The application currently loads full data sets, which can cause performance issues as the database grows. Implementing proper pagination would include:

- **API-Level Pagination**: Update all list endpoints to accept `page`, `limit`, and `offset` parameters
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: For large datasets, implement cursor-based pagination for better performance
- **React Native Integration**: Update React Query implementations to support paginated data fetching in the mobile app
- **State Management**: Maintain pagination state across navigation and filters
- **FlashList Integration**: Replace FlatList with FlashList for improved rendering performance with large lists
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Enhance the native pull-to-refresh mechanics with pagination controls

### Data Loading Optimizations
- Implement data prefetching for frequently accessed information
- Add query result caching to reduce API calls and improve offline capabilities
- Optimize API response payloads to include only necessary fields
- Implement efficient data filtering on the server side
- Utilize React Native's hermes engine optimizations

## 3. Code Organization and Architecture

### File Structure Refactoring
The current codebase could benefit from a more modular approach with smaller, single-responsibility files:

- **API Route Modularization**: Break down the large `routes.ts` file into domain-specific route files:
  ```
  /server/routes/
    ├── assetRoutes.ts
    ├── workOrderRoutes.ts
    ├── inventoryRoutes.ts
    ├── maintenanceRoutes.ts
    ├── userRoutes.ts
    └── index.ts (exports all routes)
  ```

- **Database Layer Separation**: Refactor `dbStorage.ts` into smaller, domain-specific files:
  ```
  /server/storage/
    ├── assetStorage.ts
    ├── workOrderStorage.ts
    ├── inventoryStorage.ts
    ├── maintenanceStorage.ts
    ├── userStorage.ts
    └── index.ts (exports all storage operations)
  ```

- **Component Organization**: Restructure React Native components into feature-based directories:
  ```
  /mobile/src/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── common/
    │   ├── workOrders/
    │   ├── assets/
    │   ├── inventory/
    │   └── maintenance/
    ├── screens/
    │   ├── workOrders/
    │   ├── assets/
    │   ├── inventory/
    │   └── maintenance/
    ├── navigation/
    │   ├── MainNavigator.tsx
    │   ├── WorkOrdersNavigator.tsx
    │   └── TabNavigator.tsx
    ├── hooks/
    ├── utils/
    └── api/
  ```

### Service Layer Implementation
- Add a service layer between API clients and components to encapsulate business logic
- Implement proper separation of concerns across all layers
- Create reusable business logic modules
- Improve state management with context API or Redux

## 4. Additional Feature Improvements

### Offline Support
- Enhance React Native's offline capabilities with local SQLite database
- Implement robust synchronization queue for operations performed offline
- Add conflict resolution strategies for offline changes
- Provide clear UI indicators for offline mode and sync status

### Enhanced Device Integration
- Utilize device camera for barcode/QR code scanning of assets and inventory
- Implement push notifications for critical maintenance alerts
- Add GPS location tracking for field technicians
- Integrate with device calendar for maintenance scheduling

### Mobile Experience
- Optimize touch interactions for field technicians
- Implement mobile-specific workflows for common tasks
- Add haptic feedback for important interactions
- Utilize device-specific features (e.g., Apple Pencil support on iPad)

### Integration Capabilities
- Create a comprehensive API documentation
- Implement webhooks for integration with external systems
- Add OAuth support for secure third-party access
- Create dedicated integration points for enterprise systems

### Reporting and Analytics
- Develop advanced reporting capabilities with customizable dashboards
- Implement data visualization optimized for mobile screens
- Add export functionality for reports in various formats
- Create visual maintenance history timelines

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing
- Implement Jest unit tests for business logic
- Add React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Implement Detox for end-to-end testing on actual devices
- Set up continuous integration pipeline with device farm testing

### Performance Monitoring
- Add application performance monitoring specific to React Native
- Implement crash reporting with symbolicated stack traces
- Create performance benchmarks for key user interactions
- Monitor bundle size and startup performance

## 6. Security Enhancements

### Advanced Authentication
- Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition)
- Add multi-factor authentication
- Support for enterprise single sign-on capabilities
- Enhance secure storage of credentials on device

### Fine-Grained Permissions
- Develop more granular permission controls
- Implement row-level security for sensitive data
- Add approval workflows for critical operations
- Secure local data storage with encryption

## Implementation Priority

Based on business impact and technical complexity, we recommend the following implementation priority:

1. **Pagination Implementation** - Critical for performance as data grows
2. **File Structure Refactoring** - Important for maintainability and developer productivity
3. **Entity Deletion** - Necessary for complete data lifecycle management
4. **Offline Support** - Essential for field technicians with limited connectivity
5. **Enhanced Device Integration** - Leverages native mobile capabilities
6. **Automated Testing** - Ensures reliability as the application evolves
